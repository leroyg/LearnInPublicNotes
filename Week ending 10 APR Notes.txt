Week ending 10 APR

Learned:
1- Mersenne Twister! The random() function in python uses this. http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/m-mat/MT/emt.html

2- When using the css ::before selector,we have to use content in the rules and put something or an empty string in order to see the before work.

3- DOM manipulation is wild. I learned I can declare a variable on an element, and create a custom element. I used it to make a global color scheme in my css. 

4- Attempting to serve static assets over http for an https site, breaks the rules allowed by current browsers. Good for security, and good opportunity to learn some details for me. I updated my portfolio and was serving font-awesome and google fonts via the a href link breaks things. The fix was here S/O Stack Overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26616400/fonts-and-font-awesome-icons-not-loading-over-ssl 

And some more details here https://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/

It took me a very long time to trouble shoot, BUT I felt the neurons connecting. Love it.
