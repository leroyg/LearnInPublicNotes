Questions I asnwered / Errors I solved:
https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-if-elif-else 

recalling syntax for my if/else but then realized it wasn't syntax; I wasn't calling my function! Key realization.

https://careerkarma.com/blog/python-typeerror-float-object-is-not-callable/
I kept getting an error when I was doing my tip calc math. Learned how to ensure the data types are able use the mathematical operation I needed!

https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/
More simpler string thangs. BTW I really dig f-strings. really dig.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20457038/how-to-round-to-2-decimals-with-python
The initial output kept dropping off the final zero in cases where the dollar amount rounded to a 2nd decimal place 0. Hit that problem with the ol' {f:.2}. Problem solver. 

number = 3.1415926
print(f"The number rounded to two decimal places is {number:.2f}")

Wrap thoughts:
My stand-up desk has been helpful in keeping me on task. Ironically because it requires that I sometimes switch my position and feet etc. It helps my mind stay focused because I am able to move a bit. 

My process works best when I include time-blocks. I generally use 25/5 (Pomodoro) to help me both focus and be productive but also gives a natural pause and flow to my learning. 

I always heard that one of the most important steps to coding is the planning or thinking through the steps, process. Now I understand why. Before I use to just want to get the the end result to work - but this is a false idol. Thinking through and planning helps me reflect on my level of understanding. Where I have questions in describing steps or planning data needed, actions needing to be applied to data, and what to return to the user usually mean those are places for more solid learning or understanding. It also helps keep me focused on the steps and process. All the programs are is a process which is beautiful but conniving too. 

I have learned to celebrate my wins. When I make a milestone like figuring out the logic or even a new error and ultimately having the stuff work is something to celebrate. I found it hard when I made small steps trivial in my own mind, for example, a simple input/output print to screen - I used to just try to get through to the end. Now I have learned recapping and thinking through what I did, why, and why it worked is cause for celebration! 

LIP, Learning in Public. I always thought how easy it seemed for everyone else to share what they learned or were working on publicly. I would hedge in my mind, like I will share when I hit or learn X milestone or thing or when I have something valuable for others. Like important computer learnings, not this teeny tiny simple thing I learned today. This is a false prerequisite. Also insecurity and fear of failure talking. Everyone elses LIP is irrelevant to mine, I celebrate theirs but my journey is also my own. The most important LIP component for me, is so that I CAN GO BACK and look at what I am doing or have done. This is motivation, helps learning, and leaves maybe so breadcrumbs for the next. 

Explaining or sharing or teaching helps my learning too. I share small random things I made with my wife. Of course she isn't as excited about my BMI calculator or tip calculator in the command line as I am explaining but she is excited about my excitement. I am grateful for that even though I know sometimes it probably is exasperating for her it helps me learn too. I also take her encouragement as such, I let her motivation be motivation instead being cynical about her "That's neat babe." responses. I let them be encouragement instead of thinking, "You're just saying that because you're supposed to." I used to do that in the past but it really was just a reflection of my own insecurity in this process and my capabilites. 

Last thing, building on the LIP part - setting time to recap and journal. I set Friday as an arbitray time to look back over the week at what I did. In the past learning was a non-deliniated stream of constant time in my VS Code or terminal. Invariably I would step away when frustrated or struggling with a challenge or error. Therefore if I only leave when I am frustrated eventually coming back to my terminal or whatever started feeling like, "Okay let's see if I can figure this out this time..." Sigh. Building in time blocks, breaks, space for physical activity, and recaps helps coming back to the code not always feel like climbing a mountain after collapsing in exhaustion from struggle. I come back to code refreshed, because due to time blocks, structure and process, it isn't that I leave the computer only when exhausted or frustrated. I leave because that is what my structure and process says to do. I used to prioritize brute force learning to code. Like if I code more hours than others, and out work trying to learn this is the way - it's not. Learning is a process. Now I prioritize how can I best prepare to execute my learning process. Sleep, nutrition, physical fitness, mental health - all of it helps me prioritize being most effective at my learning process. hours at the computer !== learning. Learning == learning. Process helps me be effective at learning so now I optimize for being able to perform my learning process. Grateful for these realizations.
