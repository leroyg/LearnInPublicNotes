Challenges I overcame this week:
Initially planned to solve this problem https://replit.com/@LeRoyGardner/day-3-5-exercise w

Salient observations/experiences:
1- Planning out my code; data I need, any manipulation of data needing to be performed, and the expected outcome - are very helpful and key.
2- Get things working in steps, don't try to get it all done in one step of coding things through. Test the first step and then move on.
3- My coding thought process, and problem solving approach seem to contain a recency bias - whichever tool or structure I used more recently seems to carry more weight when I evaluate how to solve a new problem. This week it was the fact I kept wanting to use the if/else when it probably was unnecessarily complicated for this application.



Things that didn't work and why:
I tried to use a for loop to solve the "Love Match" challenge, it wasn't the right tool because it looped back through each letter for each comparison, each time...
