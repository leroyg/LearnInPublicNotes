Challenges I overcame this week:

Salient observations/experiences:
1- Planning out my code; data I need, any manipulation of data needing to be performed, and the expected outcome - are very helpful and key.
2- Get things working in steps, don't try to get it all done in one step of coding things through. Test the first step and then move on.
3- My coding thought process, and problem solving approach seem to contain a recency bias - whichever tool or structure I used more recently seems to carry more weight when I evaluate how to solve a new problem. This week it was the fact I kept wanting to use the if/else when it probably was unnecessarily complicated for this application.
